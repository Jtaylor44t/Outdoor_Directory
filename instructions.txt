do I copy and paste that code into EACH file in the hiking subdirectory? So central-ohio-trails.html, northeast-ohio-trails.html, etc? I just paste this same template code in each page?

No, you don't want to paste the exact same code into each file! That would create duplicate content which is bad for SEO and user experience.
Instead, you should use this template as a starting point and customize it for each region. Here's what you need to change for each file:
What to customize for each regional page:
1. Page Title & Meta Description (in <head>)
html<!-- For central-ohio-trails.html -->
<title>Best Hiking Trails in Central Ohio - Ohio Outdoor Directory</title>
<meta name="description" content="Discover the best hiking trails in Central Ohio including Hocking Hills, Delaware State Park, and Scioto Trail State Park.">

<!-- For northwest-ohio-trails.html -->
<title>Best Hiking Trails in Northwest Ohio - Ohio Outdoor Directory</title>
<meta name="description" content="Explore the best hiking trails in Northwest Ohio including Oak Openings, Maumee Bay State Park, and Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge.">
2. Page Header Content
html<!-- Change the breadcrumb and titles -->
<div class="breadcrumb">
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a> / <a href="#">Hiking</a> / Central Ohio
</div>
<h1>Best Hiking Trails in Central Ohio</h1>
<p>Discover rugged gorges, ancient caves, and towering cliffs in Ohio's most spectacular hiking region</p>
3. Introduction Text
Update the region-specific description and stats.
4. Trail Cards
This is the most important part - each region needs completely different trails:
Central Ohio might have:

Old Man's Cave Trail (Hocking Hills)
Ash Cave Trail (Hocking Hills)
Cedar Falls Trail (Hocking Hills)
Conkle's Hollow (Hocking Hills)
Blackhand Gorge Trail
Scioto Trail

Northwest Ohio might have:

Oak Openings Hiking Trail
Wabash Cannonball Trail
Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge trails
Maumee Bay Boardwalk Trail

5. Background Images
Use different hero images that represent each region's landscape.
Recommended Approach:

Start with the Northeast template I created
Save it as your first file: northeast-ohio-trails.html
For each other region, copy the template and modify:

Page title and meta description
Header text and breadcrumbs
Introduction paragraph
Replace all 6 trail cards with trails specific to that region
Update stats if needed
Change hero background image



This way each page will have unique, valuable content for visitors and search engines while maintaining the same professional design and functionality.
Would you like me to create one more example showing how the Central Ohio version would look different?
